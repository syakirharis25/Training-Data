## 1. Introduction.
<img src="training data.png" height="300"> 
In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms work by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data.
<br /><br />
The data used to build the final model usually comes from multiple datasets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model. To develop the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) model, a precise training data is required that help algorithms to understand the certain patterns or series of outcomes comes to a given question. And training data can consist texts, images or videos which are mainly labeled to make it recognizable to computer vision and understandable to machines.
<br /><br />
Training data is basically a type of data used for training a new application, model or system through various methods depending on the project’s feasibility and requirements. And training data for AI or ML is slightly different, as they are labeled or annotated with certain techniques to make it recognizable to computer that helps machines to understand the objects.

## 3. Signal Intelligence : SIGINT in Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) of United Kingdom.
Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people (communications intelligence—abbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligence—abbreviated to ELINT). Signals intelligence is a subset of intelligence collection management. As sensitive information is often encrypted, signals intelligence in turn involves the use of cryptanalysis to decipher the messages. Traffic analysis—the study of who is signaling whom and in what quantity—is also used to integrate information again.
<br /><br />
During the Cold War, the signals intelligence (‘sigint’) produced by GCHQ constituted most of the secret information available to political decision makers, according to author Richard J Aldrich. At the end of the Cold War, GCHQ was a potential target for funding cuts. However, conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo demonstrated the ongoing value of sigint. In the 1990s, the Government made plans to expand GCHQ. In 2003, the organisation moved into a new headquarters, however, the events of 9/11 meant the building was already deemed too small.
<br /><br />
Today, GCHQ describes its modern mission as much more diverse than when it was formed. It says “supporting the military is still very much part of our role but we also now tackle the most serious cyber, terrorist, criminal, and state threats”.
